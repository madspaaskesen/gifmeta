## [0.2.0] – 2025-06-14

✨ First meaningful release

### Added
- `info` command: show frame count, size, and total duration
- `get-loop`: extract loop count (NETSCAPE2.0 extension)
- `set-loop`: modify or insert loop count (supports infinite loop via `0`)
- `set-delay`: apply fixed delay to all frames
- `show-frame-delays`: display delay values for every frame
- `set-frame-delay`: define custom delays for selected frames (frame index + delay pairs)
- Hybrid CLI and library design (usable via command line or Rust)
- Clear `clap v4` CLI with long options like `--input`, `--output`, etc.
- `parse_csv` helper to support user-friendly comma-separated input

### Changed
